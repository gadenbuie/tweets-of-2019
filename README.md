### Caveat emptor

The app is at the nice-enough-to-share prototype stage.
If anything looks wonky, odd, or out of place, it's probably just me moving quickly.
I'm sure some of the things I did here are good ideas or maybe even good practice, 
but not everything is, 
so please take it all with a grain of salt if you're looking to learn something new.

I'm putting the code online because I'd rather share â€” and to be able to find it again!
